# Bitcoin Core for Raspberry Pi

Bitcoin Core RPC client version v0.18.0.0-g2472733a24a9364e4c6233ccd04166a26a68cc65

This repository contains bitcoind, bitcoin-cli, bitcoin-tx, bitcoin-wallet and test_bitcoin compiled in Raspberry Pi Model B.

Building the bitcoin core for Raspberry was very time consuming so I'm making these publicly available for my personal backup, please feel free to use them at your own risk, I highly recommand you building these from source, I followed a great tutorial by Damian Mee - [Bitcoin Full Node on RBP3 (revised)](https://medium.com/@meeDamian/bitcoin-full-node-on-rbp3-revised-88bb7c8ef1d1).
